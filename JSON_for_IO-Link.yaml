        Parameter name. Comes from the IODD but might be reformatted according to the JSON mapping specification. \
        Constraints for strings in keys of JSON key-value-pairs (see [9]) and URLs require the following conversion rules for those names: \
        Rule 1: Names are based on the IODD XML Element Name inside variables or process data 159 resolving the text in primary language. \
        Rule 2: Only alphanumeric characters and underscores are allowed. All other characters are replaced by "_". The following regex (/[^\w\n]/g) can be used.\
        Rule 3: Leading numbers shall be prefixed with “_“.  \
        Rule 4: If there are duplicate IO-Link names, the IO-Link index or subindex has to be accessed by appending the index number or subindex number behind the name according to the following scheme: {name}_{index} or {name}_{subindex}. \
        Rule 5: Naming according the scheme {name}_{index} or {name}_{subindex} is always allowed even if names are not duplicated. \
        Rule 6: The naming of ArrayT elements is “element_{subindex}”. \
