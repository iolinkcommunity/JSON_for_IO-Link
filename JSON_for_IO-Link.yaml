    # Description

    This is an [openapi specification](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.0.3.md) for IO-Link gateways, masters and devices. 
    You can find out more about IO-Link at [http://www.io-link.com](http://www.io-link.com)


    * Draft for version 1.1.0
    * The major versioning of endpoints in case of incompatibility changes is done in the path (e.g. V1, V2, etc.) individually. Request /apiversion in order to get the full version or check the info:version: section of this specification.

    * **Security:** The defined security schemas are just examples and can be replaced by vendor specifics. The way of restricting requests is as well in the responsibility of the vendor. It is recommended to limit access to writable endpoint. This should prevent misconfiguration and breaking running systems.
